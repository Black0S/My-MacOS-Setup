Important i use '''Nerd Fonts''' for the support of custom Icons, you will need to download nerd fonts install and use it in the vscode to be able to see the icon if you modify the code properly.

Also you should intall nerd fonts for having a proper starfish terminal like mine.

Personnaly my fav Font are '''Jet Brains''' Font but the path version with icons : link : https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home
If you download and install the Jet Brains Nerd Fonts like the one i chose the confis should  work on theme sefl without any modif.
