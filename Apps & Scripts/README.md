# Nerd Fonts Configuration for VSCode and Terminal

**Important:** I use **Nerd Fonts** to support custom icons. To properly view the icons when modifying the code, you will need to:

1. Download Nerd Fonts from [Nerd Fonts Official Website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home).  
2. Install the font on your system.  
3. Configure VSCode to use the installed font.  

Additionally, installing Nerd Fonts is necessary to have a proper **Starfish-style terminal** like mine.  

**Recommended Font:**  
My personal favorite is **JetBrains Nerd Font** (patched version with icons). If you download and install the JetBrains Nerd Font that I use, the configuration should work out-of-the-box without any modifications.  

Finally, I have configured everything to use **NuShell** as my default terminal.
